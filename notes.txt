Potential out-of-the-box-solutions for pointy VR 3D stuff

### Intel RealSense
"Intel RealSense, formerly known as Intel Perceptual Computing,[1] is a platform for implementing gesture-based Human-Computer Interaction techniques.
Ut consists of series of consumer grade 3D cameras together with an easy to use machine perception library that simplifies supporting the cameras for third-party software developers.[2][3][4]"

- Intel's up-and-coming solution to depth-perceiving VR-enabled camera
- Integrated into lot of new laptops (MS Surface, Lenovo and Acer laptops etc.)

Pros & Cons
	+ Development kit only costs a 100$
	+ Seems to be well-documented
	+ Comes with ready-made depth-sensing technology
	+ Advertised as not being so dependant on IR, and working outdoors (new R200 model, not the old F200 model)

	- Currently only supports Windows 8.1 x64, with Android and other tablet support 'Coming Soon' (Who wants to carry around a laptop on top of their head!?)


### Kinect

- Microsoft's 3d sensing camera originally meant for the Xbox consoles, now adopted by many developers

	+ People have been hacking and modifying these for years, so documentation and examples exist
	+ Cheap (Aalto already owns a couple to my knowledge, it costs something like 50â‚¬)
	+ Also comes with depth-perception built in (range: minimum 800mm maximum 4000mm) or with Near Mode minimum 500mm maximum 3000mm
	+ Supports both Linux and Windows

	- Not really built for our use-case (only meant to recognize people and movement from the front, but the same can be said of all the ready-made solutions)
	- Dependant on IR --> Doesn't necessarily work outdoors in sunlight. I read the newer Kinect 2 might contain some improvements on this area?
	- Pretty bulky

### Do it ourselves.
There's always the option of ignoring all the already-existing stuff, and building our own prototype from scratch. Something like a Raspberry Pi with a webcam and OpenCV imaging library, and Bluetooth/WiFi modules and such would work.

Pros & Cons
	+ Full control of the end result and it's functionality
	+ Excellent learning opportunity!

	- We have build the prototype ourselves
	- And we have to code the functionality
	- and it'll probably be really difficult
	- Realistically speaking, will probably cost us more than mass-produced out-of-the-box solutions

ZED Stereo cam (https://www.stereolabs.com/)

- Really hi-tech solution meant for drones, self-driving cars etc.
- "The ZED Stereo Camera is the first high definition stereo sensor for depth perception. The ZED enables developers to build advanced systems that recognize their environments and take intelligent actions."

Pros & Cons

	+ Small
	+ Seems really powerful (3840x1080 px at 30fps, field of view 110 degrees, range up to 20 meters
	+ Guaranteed to work outdoors
	+ Good developer documentation and examples
	+ Support for both Linux and Windows.

	- Pretty expensive (499 dollars)
	- Range is 1.5 - 20 m (People don't have hands that long!) :(

SoftKinetic DepthSense Cameras
- Our time-of-flight CMOS 3D cameras and modules provide advanced 3D vision for consumer and industrial applications.

Pros & Cons
	+ Range is 0.10m - 5.0m which is A-OK for our usage.
	- Only available for 'strategic customers'.
	- For indoor use only

Structure depth sensor (http://structure.io/)

Pros & Cons
	+ Specifically meant to be used together with phones and tablets (especially iPad)
	+ Seems to work good for 3d imaging hands -> http://structure.io/static/occipital/images/v1/home/home-hacker-screenshot.jpg

	- Sort of expensive (499 dollars for the entire bundle)
	- "Works best indoors or outside of direct sunlight" :(

Pelican imagining
- Another mobile-first 3d imaging library

Pros & Cons

	+ Doesn't utilize IR sensors -> may work broad daylight? No specific mentions on this.
	+ Small

	- Only available on request.

All in all
- Most structured light camera sensors like the structure.io, Intel RealSense or Microsoft Kinect don't work outdoors, or at least not in direct sunlight
- However, they still might work good enough since we only need them to function in such a short range.
- 3D depth cameras are a popular technology now, can be applied with robotics, self driving cars etc
- Tried out Kinect 1, didn't really work out. Depth buffer wasn't accurate at close ranges, as it's meant to be put on top of your TV in your living room.

- Kinect 2 has built in hand recognition
- Kinect 2 for windows not manufactured anymore, but has closer operating range than regular kinect 2
